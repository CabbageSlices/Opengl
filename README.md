# Opengl
Simple rendering engine made with C++ and OpenGL. Created to use as a testbed for various rendering effects.
Currently loads and renders a mesh from a .obj file with support for textures, point lights, direcitonal lights, and shadows (both point and directional).
Uses a custom blueprint schema to specify material properties and shaders.

Planned to add in the future:

- Deferred rendering
- Forward+ rendering
- multi render pass specification via blueprint
- Global illumination
